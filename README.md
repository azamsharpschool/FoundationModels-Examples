# 🍎 Apple Foundation Model Framework Examples

Welcome to the **Apple Foundation Model Framework Examples** project! This repository showcases practical examples, demos, and experiments using Apple’s new Foundation Models Framework introduced at WWDC 2025.

## Projects 

## 🔍 [Transcript Summarizer Using Apple Foundation Models](/HelloWorld/)

This project uses Apple’s Foundation Models Framework to summarize long transcript text into five concise lines. It leverages on-device machine learning to extract key ideas and present them in a clear, readable format. 

## 🌲🏞️ [National Park Trip Planner](/Travel/)
**National Park Trip Planner** is a SwiftUI-powered app that helps users plan personalized 3-day itineraries for U.S. national parks. With just a tap, the app generates detailed day-by-day activity suggestions tailored to each park—highlighting scenic spots, hiking trails, and must-see landmarks. Whether you're visiting Yosemite or the Everglades, this app offers an easy, engaging way to explore the best each park has to offer. All recommendations are generated on-device using Apple's Foundation Models framework for privacy and speed.

## 😂 [Dad Jokes Generator](/Jokes/)

Jokes is a SwiftUI app that uses Apple’s Foundation Models Framework to generate and display classic dad jokes. It showcases how to integrate Tool-based AI functionality using LanguageModelSession and @Generable types. The app includes a custom DadJokesTool that returns random puns, demonstrating how to build and register tools that respond to natural language prompts. Ideal for learning how to use tools in the Foundation Models ecosystem for interactive, AI-powered features.

> These examples will be part of my upcoming course on Apple Foundation Models Framework. Course will be available on AzamSharp School (https://azamsharp.school).
